# Notebooks for Conx, on-ramp to Deep Learning

This repository is a collection of notebooks for the Python 3 module `conx`.

You can read about conx here: https://conx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The easiest way to get these notebooks for use in the notebook is to:

```
import conx as cx
cx.download("https://github.com/Calysto/conx-notebooks/archive/master.zip")
```

followed by:

```
! jupyter trust conx-notebooks-master/*.ipynb
```

in the notebook, or, without the exclaimation point, at the console.
