We will demonstrate ideas through animation and visualizations, examine the path to advanced topics, and explore ideas for incorporating Deep Learning topics into the classroom. **The workshop is designed to allow participants to gain a foothold with these complex topics, and to help them develop their own materials for teaching.**"
